# Zodiac polish log

Running log of small improvements and bug fixes, one commit each. Started

Each entry: what changed, why, and the commit. Unresolved items / follow-ups
are collected at the bottom.

## Changes

<!-- new entries go here, newest first -->

### 3. Bare `www.` links in the transcript
`www.example.com` (no scheme) is now detected and rendered as a clickable
link with an `https://` href, alongside the existing bare-http detection.
Requires a dot after `www.` so `www.` alone isn't linked. `ui.rs`
(`parse_www_url`, shared `consume_url_token`).

### 2. Nested list indentation in the transcript
Sub-lists were flattened because `md_block` trims leading whitespace. Now the
leading indent (2 spaces / 1 tab per level, capped at 6) is measured and
applied as a pixel inset to bullet, task, and ordered-list rows, so nested
lists read as nested. `ui.rs` (`list_indent_px`).

### 1. Markdown task-list checkboxes in the transcript
`- [ ] todo` / `- [x] done` now render a checkbox glyph (☐ / ☑) instead of a
plain bullet; done items are dimmed. Agents emit these constantly (plans,
progress). `md_block` detects the `[ ]`/`[x]` prefix (case-insensitive x) and
routes to a new `md_task_row`. `ui.rs`.
