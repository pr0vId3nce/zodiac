## Changes

<!-- new entries go here, newest first -->

### 1. Markdown task-list checkboxes in the transcript
`- [ ] todo` / `- [x] done` now render a checkbox glyph (☐ / ☑) instead of a
plain bullet; done items are dimmed. Agents emit these constantly (plans,
progress). `md_block` detects the `[ ]`/`[x]` prefix (case-insensitive x) and
routes to a new `md_task_row`. `ui.rs`.
